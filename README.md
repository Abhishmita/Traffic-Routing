# Traffic-Routing
Shortest path for traffic

This project is to find the shortest path for traffic in case of any non-recurring incidents. It may include, accidents, road construction, locked roads, etc.

The idea is to take one souce and destination and find the shortest road from source to destination.

The testing process is to create a simulation of the junctions.
